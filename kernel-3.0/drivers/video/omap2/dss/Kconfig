	  The amount of SDRAM to reserve at boot time for video RAM use.
	  This VRAM will be used by omapfb and other drivers that need

	help
	  MIPI DBI support (RFBI, Remote Framebuffer Interface, in Texas
	  Instrument's terminology).

	  DBI is a bus between the host processor and a peripheral,

config OMAP2_DSS_FAKE_VSYNC

	  If this is selected, DSI will generate a fake DISPC VSYNC interrupt

	help
	  This can be used to adjust the minimum FCK/PCK ratio.

	  With this you can make sure that DISPC FCK is at least
	  n x PCK. Video plane scaling requires higher FCK than
	  normally.

	  If this is set to 0, there's no extra constraint on the
	  DISPC FCK. However, the FCK will at minimum be
	  2xPCK (if active matrix) or 3xPCK (if passive matrix).

	  Max FCK is 173MHz, so this doesn't work if your PCK
	  is very high.

config OMAP2_DSS_SLEEP_AFTER_VENC_RESET
	bool "Sleep 20ms after VENC reset"
	default y
	help
	  There is a 20ms sleep after VENC reset which seemed to fix the
	  reset. The reason for the bug is unclear, and it's also unclear
	  on what platforms this happens.

	  This option enables the sleep, and is enabled by default. You can
	  disable the sleep if it doesn't cause problems on your platform.

	default y
	help
	  The GFX fifo on OMAP4 is smaller than the other fifos. The small fifo
	  causes problems with certain use cases, like using the tiler in 2D
	  mode. The below hack swaps the fifos of GFX and WB planes, thus
	  giving GFX plane a larger fifo. WB but should work fine with a
	  smaller fifo.
