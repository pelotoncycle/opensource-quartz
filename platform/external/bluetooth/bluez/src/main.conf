# List of plugins that should not be loaded on bluetoothd startup
# When Generic GATT Server Profiles (GGSP) module is used for implementing
# profiles non-natively (i.e. in Java), most (if not all) native GATT server
# profiles should be disabled. Otherwise, it will not be possible to install
# the GGSP equivalents without conflicting with the native ones.
